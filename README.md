# Gotta Catch 'Em All - Pokemon Search
This is a recruitment project that search Pokemon using PokeAPI.

## Technologies and libraries
- **Aurelia**: The main framework used for building the user interface.
- **Aurelia Router**: for managing views
- **RxJS**: Used for managing the state of the application.
- **LESS**: Used for styling the applicationâ€™s components.
- **Lottie**: Used for displaying loading animations.

## Description
The "Gotta Catch 'em All Pokemon Search" project is an interactive web application consisting of two main views: 'Search' and 'Details'. The application allows users to search for Pokemon by name (both complete and partial) and by color. Upon selecting a Pokemon, the user is transitioned to the 'Details' view. During data loading, a loading animation is displayed. Detailed information about the selected Pokemon includes its name, statistics, and an image. This application provides a user-friendly interface for Pokemon enthusiasts to explore and learn more about their favorite creatures.

- Efficient Initial Loading: The application initially fetches a complete list of Pokemon and stores this data in localStorage for faster access on subsequent visits.
- State Management with BehaviorSubject: Uses BehaviorSubject to effectively manage and share application state across components.
- Alphabetical Display of Results: Search results are sorted alphabetically for easy navigation.
- Placeholder for Missing Images: If an image is not available in the API, a placeholder image is displayed for consistency.
